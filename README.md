## Instructions
While standing next to the desired tree or ore vein simply hold shift while you break the block and all adjacent blocks of that type will break instantly and the tool used will take damage according to the broken blocks. If the tool itself would break during the mining/chopping no further blocks will be broken for realistic reasons

Wood chopping requires an axe to work and can chop any type of wood or nether planks
